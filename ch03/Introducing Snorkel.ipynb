    "In this chapter I will introduce [Snorkel](http://snorkel.org), which we'll use throughout the book. [Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/) is a software project ([github](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)) originally from the Hazy Research group at Stanford University enabling the practice of *weak supervision*, *distant supervision*, *data augmentation* and *data slicing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has an excellent [Get Started](https://www.snorkel.org/get-started/) page, and I recommend you spend some time working the [tutorials](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials) before proceeding beyond this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Snorkel implements an unsupervised generative model that accepts a matrix of weak labels for records in your training data and produces strong labels by learning the relationships between these weak labels through matrix factorization."

    "### Labeling Functions (LFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function is a deterministic function used to label data as belonging to one class or another. They produce weak labels that in combination, through Snorkel’s generative models, can be used to generate strong labels for unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Snorkel paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10160.pdf) explains that LFs are open ended, that is that they can leverage information from multiple sources - both inside and outside the record. For example LFs can operate over different parts of the input document, working with document metadata, entire texts, individual paragraphs, sentences or words, parts of speech, named entities extracted by preprocessors, text embeddings or any augmentation of the record whatsoever. They can simultaneously leverage external databases and rules through *distant supervision*. These might include vocabulary for keyword searches, heuristics defined by theoretical considerations or equations, \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a preprocessor might run a text document through a language model such as the included `SpacyPreprocessor` to run Named Entity Resolution (NER) and then look for words queried from WikiData that correspond to a given class. There are many ways to write LFs. We’ll define a broad taxonomy and then demonstrate some techniques from each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program interface for Labeling Functions is [`snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction`](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.5/packages/_autosummary/labeling/snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction.html#snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction). They are instantiated with a name, a function reference, any resources the function needs and a list of any preprocessors to run on the data records before the labeling function runs.\n",

    "### Defining Labeling Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write our first labeling function, we need to define the label schema for our problem. The first label in any labeling schema is `-1` for `ABSTAIN`, which means \"cast no vote\" about the class of the record. This allows Snorkel Labeling Functions to vote only when they are certain, and is critical to how the system works since labeling functions have to perform better than random when they do vote or the Label Model won't work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels for this analysis are:\n",

For now we'll create this and a couple of other LFs and see where that gets us."
