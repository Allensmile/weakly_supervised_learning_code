    "# Chapter 3: Introducing Snorkel\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter I will introduce [Snorkel](http://snorkel.org), which we'll use throughout the book. [Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/) is a software project ([github](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)) originally from the Hazy Research group at Stanford University enabling the practice of *weak supervision*, *distant supervision*, *data augmentation* and *data slicing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has an excellent [Get Started](https://www.snorkel.org/get-started/) page, and I recommend you spend some time working the [tutorials](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials) before proceeding beyond this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Snorkel implements an unsupervised generative model that accepts a matrix of weak labels for records in your training data and produces strong labels by learning the relationships between these weak labels through matrix factorization."

    "The point of Snorkel is that you don't need labels - so we won't be using labels with the training dataset, `train_df`. Therefore we delete that variable to keep ourselves honest :) We also keep the development dataset `dev_df` small to demonstrate that you only need to label a small amount of representative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've prepared our three dataset splits, because the labeled dev dataset `dev_df` is small, we run a value count for each of its labels to verify we have an adequate number of each label. It looks like we have around ten, which will do. People use Snorkel without any labels at all but at least ten of each label is very helpful in evaluating the performance, as we code, of the data programs we'll be writing to label data/"

    "### Labeling Functions (LFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function is a deterministic function used to label data as belonging to one class or another. They produce weak labels that in combination, through Snorkel’s generative models, can be used to generate strong labels for unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Snorkel paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10160.pdf) explains that LFs are open ended, that is that they can leverage information from multiple sources - both inside and outside the record. For example LFs can operate over different parts of the input document, working with document metadata, entire texts, individual paragraphs, sentences or words, parts of speech, named entities extracted by preprocessors, text embeddings or any augmentation of the record whatsoever. They can simultaneously leverage external databases and rules through *distant supervision*. These might include vocabulary for keyword searches, heuristics defined by theoretical considerations or equations, \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a preprocessor might run a text document through a language model such as the included `SpacyPreprocessor` to run Named Entity Resolution (NER) and then look for words queried from WikiData that correspond to a given class. There are many ways to write LFs. We’ll define a broad taxonomy and then demonstrate some techniques from each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program interface for Labeling Functions is [`snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction`](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.5/packages/_autosummary/labeling/snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction.html#snorkel.labeling.LabelingFunction). They are instantiated with a name, a function reference, any resources the function needs and a list of any preprocessors to run on the data records before the labeling function runs.\n",

The first label in any labeling schema is `-1` for `ABSTAIN`, which means \"cast no vote\" about the class of the record. This allows Snorkel Labeling Functions to vote only when they are certain, and is critical to how the system works since labeling functions have to perform better than random when they do vote or the Label Model won't work well.\n",

For now we'll create this and a couple of other LFs and see where that gets us."

    "Snorkel comes with tools to help you run your LFs on your dataset to see how they perform. We're using Pandas, so we use [`snorkel.labeling.PandasLFApplier`](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/_autosummary/labeling/snorkel.labeling.PandasLFApplier.html) to apply our list of label functions (in this case just one) to the hand-labeled development dataset `dev_df` and the unlabeled training dataset `train_df`. Note that there are also `LFAppliers` for [Dask](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/_autosummary/labeling/snorkel.labeling.apply.dask.DaskLFApplier.html) and [PySpark](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/_autosummary/labeling/snorkel.labeling.apply.spark.SparkLFApplier.html#snorkel.labeling.apply.spark.SparkLFApplier)."

    "Looks better! While 3:0 is not overwhelming support I happen to know there are many Ion projects and it is likely they mostly follow this pattern. Remember, `LabelingFunctions` don't have to be perfect - they just have to perform better than random. The magic of Snorkel's `LabelModel` is that it is unsupervised and models the interactions between LFs as a generative, graphical model it then uses to predict strong labels. When combined, these LFs give the model enough signal work do its job, turning multiple weak labels into one strong label.\n",

The description pattern matches two more records, otherwise they fully overlap. I'm going to leave both LFs in and move on to writing more LFs before we deal with evaluating results."
